## Planning
The planning stage is important, as all projects in your future roles will have detailed plans before any coding happens. It is a great experience to share with potential engineer employers, as this reflects real engineering team practices. 

Discuss every step you took in the planning stage, including the relevant images. This includes sketches, wireframes, ERDs, project management tools, pseudocode, and task allocation if it was a group or pair project.

## Build/Code Process
The Build/Code Process will be the longest section of your ReadMe and will be most insightful to the engineers that review them. Discuss the steps you took to code the project, including key sections of the project build and at least 3-4 code snippets with descriptions on what you did, how, and why.
